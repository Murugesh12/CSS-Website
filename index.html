    <!-- Images behave differently than other elements during alignment, this is due to display
    property - display property is of mainly 4 types:
    Block: Takes up whole space of page and do not allow other elements to exist in same region (or) line, however
    properties such as width may be altered Eg: Para, Headers, Divs, Lists and Forms
    Inline: Takes up only necesary space and can be stacked close to eachother, however properties such as
    width cannot be altered Eg: Spans, Images(Kinda), Anchors
    Inline-block: Best of both Inline and Block, can be stacked next to eachother and properties can be altered
    None: Removes particular element as if it didnt exist
    Display property can be changed in CSS
    You may also change the Visibility of a particular element such that the position of other elements are adjusted
    relative to it and yet it is invisible-->
    <!--Position: Position is of 4 types:
    Static: All HTML elements are static by default. It means they follow the default HTML rules and go with the HTML follow
    Relative: Postion the element that we select relative to how it would have been postioned had it been a static element,
    ie It moves from the position it was previously in and does not affect the position of other elements
    Absolute: Position of element is relative to its Parent element; when moved it affects the postion of other elements as it
    is no longer considered as part of the natural flow. By default the 'parent' is the body-->
